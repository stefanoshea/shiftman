# Shiftman
## _The ultimate shift planner_

## Dependencies
I added the Swinject framework using SPM as the only dependency for the project. I did this to improve the testability of the code and to acheive inversion of control. I chose Swiject in particular because I find it to be quite lightweight, yet powerful.
